# Robo3Duino
Robo3Duino is a matrix based library to operate with Transformation matrix for robots with Arduino.  Robo3Duino is a generic library useful for Advanced Robotics Applications.

This library is part of a educational course to learn C++ with Arduino in practice with https://github.com/blascarr/Robo3Duino Course or http://www.blascarr.com/ webpage.

This Library gives some helpful methods to manipulate transformation Matrix in order to create references, manipulation in 3D.

With Robo3Duino we can integrate different methods based on Matrix with BasicLinearAlgebra library.
